# Simple-Python-Calculator
Nothing too interesting, just a simple two-value calculator coded in Python
I made this to make sure I know how to do basic math in Python, so I didn't think to put anything in functions until the last minute, so that's why it looks like that.

Desired operation refers to methods of operation such as Addition/Add/Plus, Subtraction/Subtract/Minus, Multplication/Multiply/Times, and Division/Divide (not case sensitive).

Integer 1 refers to the first integer in an expression

Integer 2 refers to the second integer in an expression

Output should be the described equation, with the result followed by an equals sign at the end
